<!-- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and 
     structuring web documents. It uses a system of tags and attributes to define 
     the elements on a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, links, and more. 
     HTML provides the basic structure for content on the World Wide Web and is 
     essential for creating web pages. -->

<!-- A comment in HTML is a way to add annotations or notes within the code. 
     Comments are not displayed in the browser and are ignored during the rendering 
     of the webpage. They serve as helpful explanations for developers and are crucial 
     for code documentation. -->

<!-- Elements in HTML define the structure and content of a web page. They include 
     tags like <html>, <head>, <body>, <h1>, <p>, etc., each serving a specific 
     purpose in organizing and presenting information. -->

<!-- A tag in HTML is a fundamental building block that defines an element. 
     It consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Tags are used 
     to structure and format the content on a webpage, providing a standardized 
     way to create and display various elements such as headings, paragraphs, 
     links, etc. -->

<!-- Attributes in HTML provide additional information or behavior to elements. 
     For example, the 'lang' attribute in the <html> tag specifies the language 
     of the document, aiding in language-specific processing or styling. Attributes 
     can be found in various HTML tags, enhancing the functionality and presentation 
     of the content. -->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- This declaration defines the document to be HTML5 -->

<html lang="en-us"> <!-- This is the opening tag for the HTML document, specifying 
                      the language as English (United States) -->
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title> <!-- This is the title of the HTML document, displayed in the browser's title bar or tab -->
    
    <!-- Link to an external CSS file for styling -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">

    <!--Internal CSS uses the <style> tag-->
    <style>
      /*
        The <style> tag is used to embed CSS Cascading Style Sheets within the HTML document.
        It allows you to define the presentation and layout of elements on the webpage.

        It allows you to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage.
