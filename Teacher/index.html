  When you're writing HTML code, it's a good idea to organize it neatly. 
  You can do this by adding spaces or tabs at the beginning of each line to create a consistent structure. 
  For every child element (like a paragraph or heading) inside a parent element (like a section or body), 
  you should indent them to show their relationship. 

  This helps make your HTML code more readable and easier to understand.
