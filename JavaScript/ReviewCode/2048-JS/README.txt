2048 is a popular single-player sliding puzzle game. 
The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid, combining matching numbers to create a tile with the sum of the merged tiles. 
The game starts with two tiles, and the player must strategically move tiles to achieve the elusive "2048" tile. 
The game continues until the grid is full and no more moves are possible, at which point the player's score is calculated based on the values of the tiles on the board. 
Success requires planning and careful tile management to reach the highest possible score.
